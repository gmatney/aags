	UNITS: COST EFFICIENCY PERCENTAGES FOR INFLICTING CASUALTIES

Each unit has a cost. Most have attack and defense values. 
A percentage has been caluclated here for each unit’s attack or defense 
by dividing the unit’s attack or defense by its cost. 

For example, infantry attack at 1 and cost 3, 
1 is divided by 3 to get an infantry attack of 33%. 
Similarly, infantry defend at 2 or less and cost 3, so 2 
is divided by 3 to get an infantry defense of 67%. 
Higher percentages indicate higher cost efficiencies at 
inflicting casualties on an initial round of combat.

Artillery    |Cost  4| attack 2| defense 2| Attack 50%| Defense 50%|
Tank         |Cost  5| attack 3| defense 3| Attack 60%| Defense 60%| Moves two
Inf-Artlly   |Cost  7|         |            Attack 57%| Defense 57%|
Inf-tank     |Cost  8|         |            Attack 50%| Defense 63%|

Destroyer    |Cost  8| attack 2| defense 2| Attack 25%| Defense 25%| Hunts subs
Cruiser      |Cost 12| attack 3| defense 3| Attack 25%| Defense 25%| Support shot

Special	
Transport    |Cost  7|         |          |           |             |       | Transports units. Noncombatant.
Antiaircraft |Cost  6| Special. Can prevent a tank from blitzing.
IndustComplex|Cost 15| Special. Can prevent a tank from blitzing.





COMBINATIONS OF UNITS: COST EFFICIENCY PERCENTAGES FOR INFLICTING CASUALTIES
The percentages of the below listed combinations of units come from taking the respective sums of a unit combination’s cost, attack, and defense, and dividing. For example, an infantry-tank combination costs a total of 8 (3 for infantry 5 for tank), has a total attack of 4 (1 for infantry 3 for tank), and total defense of 5 (2 for infantry 3 for tank). 4 is divided by 8 to get an attack of 50%; 5 is divided by 8 to get a defense of 63%.
