Axis and Allies Game Server

This is to help you play the board game over long distances.
This does not replace the game itself.
Buy the game.
You may note this does not include a copy of the rules.
That's because you should have a copy of the rules from your physical copy.

This is to allow you to build an AI to help you 
test strategies to help you play better.

Or to show stats to help you make an informed decision on your future
game moves.
